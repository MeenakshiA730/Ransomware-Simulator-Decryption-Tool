**Ransomware Simulator**
Overview
This project is a Ransomware Simulator, designed for educational and research purposes. It helps cybersecurity professionals understand ransomware in a controlled environment. Use responsibly and only in authorized test environments.
What is Ransomware?
Ransomware is malware that encrypts a victim's files, making them inaccessible. Attackers demand a ransom, usually in cryptocurrency, for decryption. Ransomware causes financial loss, data breaches, and operational disruptions.
History of Ransomware
The first known ransomware attack, AIDS Trojan (1989), spread via floppy disks, encrypting filenames and demanding payment. Modern variants like WannaCry, Ryuk, and REvil use advanced encryption and exploit system vulnerabilities.
How Ransomware Works
1. Infection: Delivered through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploit kits.
2. Execution: Scans the system for files to encrypt.
3. Encryption: Uses strong algorithms (e.g., AES, RSA) to lock files.
4. Ransom Demand: Displays a note with payment instructions.
5. Payment & Decryption: No guarantee of decryption after payment.
Types of Ransomware
- Encrypting Ransomware: Encrypts files and demands payment (e.g., CryptoLocker, WannaCry).
- Locker Ransomware: Blocks access to devices without encrypting files.
- Scareware: Displays fake warnings and demands payment.
- Doxware (Leakware): Threatens to leak sensitive data unless paid.
Impact of Ransomware
- Financial Loss: Costs from ransom payments and recovery efforts.
- Operational Disruption: Can shut down businesses and critical services.
- Reputational Damage: Data breaches harm public trust.
- Legal Consequences: Some regulations impose penalties for poor cybersecurity.
Prevention Strategies
- Regular Backups: Maintain offline and cloud backups.
- Security Awareness: Train employees to recognize threats.
- Updated Security Software: Use antivirus and endpoint protection.
- Patch Management: Keep systems updated.
- Network Segmentation: Isolate critical systems.
- Zero Trust Security: Restrict access based on verification.
